== File-system based KieScanner

The `KieScanner` allows continuous monitoring of your Maven repository to check whether a new release of a Kie project has been installed
and if so it live updates the running `KieContainer` with the newer version of that project. However in many cases installing a maven
repository is impractical especially in production environment. For this reason it is now possible to have a `KieScanner` that works
by simply fetching update from a folder of a plain file system. You can create and start such a `KieScanner` as simply as

====
[source,java]
----
KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieScanner kScanner = kieServices.newKieScanner( kContainer, "/myrepo/kjars" );

// Start the KieScanner polling the Maven repository every 10 seconds
kScanner.start( 10000L );
----
====

where "/myrepo/kjars" will be the folder where the `KieScanner` will look for kjar updates. The jar files placed in this folder
have to follow the maven convention and then have to be a name in the form {artifactId}-{versionId}.jar
