== New and Noteworthy in Integration 6.2.0

=== KIE Execution Server


A new KIE Execution Server was created with the goal of supporting the deployment of kjars and the automatic creation of REST endpoints for remote rules execution.
This initial implementation supports provisioning and execution of kjars via REST without any glue code.

A user interface was also integrated into the workbench for remote provisioning.
See the workbench's New&Noteworthy for details.
